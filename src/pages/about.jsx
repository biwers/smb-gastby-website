    <p>
      SMB is a privately owned commercial service company based in Kurdistan,
      Iraq. We are specialists in the delivery of consultancy and bespoke,
      custom-built service solutions. Our key objectives as an organisation is
      customer and employee satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      SMB focuses on providing an exceptional level of service to a manageable
      number of customers. Our commitment to customer satisfaction is second to
      none, and we aim to be a complete service partner for our clients, from
      initial consultancy and design phases right through to deployment and
      ongoing support services, such as construction design and logistical
      support.
    </p>

    <p>
      SMB are happy to undertake work on a fixed-price, fixed-timescale basis -
      so our customers can be confident of what they're getting when, and at
      what price. They can budget and plan their project strategy accurately, a
      luxury of which most commercial companies merely dream. In an industry
      where the majority of projects are delivered late or over-budget, this
      gives our customers (and us) a huge competitive advantage. Smb Logo

    <p>
      Finally, we offer genuine value for money to our clients. We believe the
      quality of our staff and service to be superior to almost all of the
      biggest and best names in the industry - many of whom charge fees at least
      two or three times that of SMB. Our track record in these key areas has
      earned us both an impressive reputation and a loyal customer base who
      respect and trust us.
    </p>
    <p>
      After customer satisfaction, SMB's second key objective is employee
      satisfaction. A much overlooked fact in the business world is that one of
      the easiest ways to achieve the first objective is to focus on the second.
      We recruit only extremely able applicants as service providers and train
      up from there. All are top-class, highly motivated, team personnel. We
      provide a great working environment for our employees, with interesting
      and challenging work, ongoing training and mentoring and a good
      remuneration package and bonus's.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a result, we have built up a team of enthusiastic, talented and
      experienced team members and consultants with extremely low staff
      turnover. This gives SMB a clear return on the investment in our employees
      and allows us to offer our customers a consistency of staffing from which
      they also benefit.
    </p>
    <p>
      SMB is a successful company. We have no debts or liabilities, and an
      annual turnover of around £3million with a healthy profit, and are
      expanding our business with reinvested revenue.
